# Lab 4: Using Windows Admin Center in hybrid scenarios

## Lab scenario

To address concerns regarding the consistent operational and management model, regardless of the location of managed systems, you'll test the capabilities of Windows Admin Center in the hybrid environment containing different versions of the Windows Server operating system running on-premises and in Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs).

Your goal is to verify that Windows Admin Center can be used in a consistent manner regardless of the location of managed systems.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-800%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Using%20Windows%20Admin%20Center%20in%20hybrid%20scenarios)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform:

- Exercise 1:  Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server
- Exercise 2: Implementing hybrid connectivity by using the Azure Network Adapter
- Exercise 3: Deploying Windows Admin Center gateway in Azure
- Exercise 4: Verifying functionality of the Windows Admin Center gateway in Azure

## Estimated time: 90 minutes

## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server

#### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. Connect to **SEA-ADM1**, and if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, start Microsoft Edge, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by using the following credentials : 

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell pane by selecting the toolbar icon directly next to the search text box.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

   >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting Cloud Shell and you are presented with the **Getting started** page, select the subscription you are using in this lab, then select **No storage account required**, and **Apply**.

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Manage Files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload**, and then upload the **C:\Labfiles\AZ-800-Administering-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Core-Infrastructure-master\Allfiles\Labfiles\Lab04\L04-sub_template.json** file to the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands to create a resource group that will contain the resources you provision in this lab. (Replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of an Azure region into which you can deploy Azure virtual machines, such as **eastus**.)

   >**Note**: This lab has been tested and verified using East US, so you should use that region. In general, to identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [Find Azure credit offers in your region](https://aka.ms/regions-offers).

   ```powershell
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   $rgName = 'AZ800-L0401-RG'
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name az800l04subDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/L04-sub_template.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName $rgName
   ```

#### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload an Azure Resource Manager template **C:\Labfiles\AZ-800-Administering-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Core-Infrastructure-master\Allfiles\Labfiles\Lab04\L04-rg_template.json** and the corresponding Azure Resource Manager parameter file **C:\Labfiles\AZ-800-Administering-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Core-Infrastructure-master\Allfiles\Labfiles\Lab04\L04-rg_template.parameters.json**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to deploy an Azure VM running Windows Server that you'll be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -Name az800l04rgDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/L04-rg_template.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/L04-rg_template.parameters.json
   ```

   >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next exercise. The deployment should take about 5 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box in the toolbar, search for and select the virtual network, and then on the **Virtual network** page select **az800l04-vnet**.

1. On the **az800l04-vnet** page, under **Settings** section, select **Subnets**, and then, on the **Subnets** page, select **+ subnet**.

1. On the **Add subnet** page, set the 
   - **Subnet Purpose** to **Virtual Network Gateway** (1)
   - **Starting address** to **10.4.3.224** (2)
   - **Size** to **/27** (3) , and then select **Add** to create the **GatewaySubnet**.

#### Task 2: Identify all Azure resources provisioned in the lab

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to list all the resource groups created throughout this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ800-L040*'
   ```

1. Run the following command to delete all the resource groups you created throughout this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ800-L040*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you'll be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
