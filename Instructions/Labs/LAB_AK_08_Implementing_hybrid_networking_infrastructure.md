# Lab 8: Implementing hybrid networking infrastructure

## Lab scenario

You were tasked with building a test environment in Azure, consisting of Microsoft Azure virtual machines deployed into separate virtual networks configured in the hub and spoke topology. This testing must include implementing connectivity between spokes by using user-defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub. You also need to implement DNS name resolution for Azure virtual machines between virtual networks by using Azure private DNS zones and evaluate the use of Azure DNS zones for external name resolution.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-800%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Implementing%20hybrid%20networking%20infrastructure)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Exercise 1: Implement virtual network routing in Azure
-  Exercise 2: Implement DNS name resolution in Azure

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

    > **Note**: **10.82.0.4** represents the private IP address of **az800l08-vm2**. 

1. Select **Run diagnostic tests** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Verify that the status is **Reachable (success)**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

    > **Note**: This is expected because the hub virtual network is peered directly with the second spoke virtual network.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** page, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values) and initiate another check:

    > **Note**: You might need to refresh the browser page for the virtual machine **az800l08-vm1** to appear in the **Virtual machine** drop-down list.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Source type | **Virtual machine** |
    | Virtual machine | **az800l08-vm1** |
    | Destination | **Specify manually** |
    | URI, FQDN or IP address | **10.82.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |
    | Diagnostic tests | Select **Connectivity** and **Next hop** from the list |

1. Select **Run diagnostic tests** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Note that the status is **Unreachable**.

      ![](media/Ex-1-T3-S8.png)

    > **Note**: This is expected because the two spoke virtual networks are not peered with each other and virtual network peering is not transitive.

1. Select **OK**

1. On the DNS zone page, identify the full name of **Name server 1**.

    >**Note**: Record the full name of **Name server 1**. You will need it in the next task.

#### Task 4: Validate Azure public DNS name resolution

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, on the **Start** menu, select **Windows PowerShell**.

1. In the **Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following command, and then press Enter to test external name resolution of the **www** DNS record set in the newly created DNS zone (replace the placeholder `<Name server 1>` with the name of **Name server 1** you noted earlier in this task and the `<domain name>` placeholder with the name of the DNS domain you created earlier in this task):

   ```powershell
   nslookup www.<domain name> <Name server 1>
   ```

1. Verify that the output of the command includes the public IP address of **20.30.40.50**.

    >**Note**: The name resolution works as expected because the **nslookup** command allows you to specify the IP address of the DNS server to query for a record (which, in this case, is `<Name server 1>`). For the name resolution to work when querying any publicly accessible DNS server, you would need to register the domain name with a DNS registrar and configure the name servers listed on the public DNS zone page in the Azure portal as authoritative for the namespace corresponding to that domain.
